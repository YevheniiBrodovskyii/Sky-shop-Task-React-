## ["GitHub Pages Link"](https://yevheniibrodovskyii.github.io/Sky-shop-Task-React-/)

This project was made for a recruitment quest

## The task

The task is to display the list of products in HTML using Ajax to the products.json file which contains a JSON object containing the product name, product status and price. In the list, add select to filter products by status ("prod_status": "recommended | saleout | bestseller | promotion | new",). An example of the list view is shown below. The list should be responsive. The photo for the product can be an ordinary placeholder.

### About development

#### The project was made on React 18.0.0

#### I also used framework ["Materialize"](https://materializecss.com/) for faster styling and responsiveness
